Whiley Theorem Prover (WyTP)
======================================================================

The Whiley Theorem Prover provides an automatic and interactive
theorem prover designed specifically for use with the Whiley Compiler.
The prover accepts assertions written in the Whiley Assertion Language
(WyAL) and attempts to prove they are correct (or not).  In many
cases, such assertions can be discharged automatically.  However, in
some cases, manual intervention is required through the use of an
interactive proof.  The theorem prover provides a simple interface for
performing such proofs.

An example assertion accepted and discharged automatically by WyTP is:

> assert:
>   forall(int[] xs):
>      if:
>         forall(int i):
> 	    xs[i] >= 0
>      then:
>         |xs| == 0 || xs[0] >= 0

The Whiley Theorem Prover was developed by David Pearce, starting
around 2010.
