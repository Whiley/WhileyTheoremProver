	 * clause before the others.</li>
	 * <li><b>Requires clause</b>. This defines a constraint on the permissible
	 * values of the parameters on entry to the function or method, and is often
	 * referred to as the "precondition". This expression may refer to any
	 * variables declared within the parameter type pattern. Multiple clauses

	 * the convention is to specify the requires clause(s) before any ensure(s)

	 * As an example consider a record expression, such as
	 * <code>{x: e1, y: e2}</code>. Here, the sub-expression "e1" must be a
	 * non-tuple expression since it is followed by ',' to signal the start of
	 * the next field "y". Of course, e1 can be a tuple expression if we use
	 * brackets as these help disambiguate the context.

	/**
	 * Parse an expression beginning with a left brace. This is either a cast or
	 * bracketed expression:
	 *
	 * <pre>
	 * BracketedExpr ::= '(' Type ')' Expr
	 *                      | '(' Expr ')'
	 * </pre>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * The challenge here is to disambiguate the two forms (which is similar to
	 * the problem of disambiguating a variable declaration from e.g. an
	 * assignment). Getting this right is actually quite tricky, and we need to
	 * consider what permissible things can follow a cast and/or a bracketed
	 * expression. To simplify things, we only consider up to the end of the
	 * current line in determining whether this is a cast or not. That means
	 * that the expression following a cast *must* reside on the same line as
	 * the cast.
	 * </p>
	 *
	 * <p>
	 * A cast can be followed by the start of any valid expression. This
	 * includes: identifiers (e.g. "(T) x"), braces of various kinds (e.g.
	 * "(T) [1,2]" or "(T) (1,2)"), unary operators (e.g. "(T) !x", "(T) |xs|",
	 * etc). A bracketed expression, on the other hand, can be followed by a
	 * binary operator (e.g. "(e) + 1"), a left- or right-brace (e.g.
	 * "(1 + (x+1))" or "(*f)(1)") or a newline.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Most of these are easy to disambiguate by the following rules:
	 * </p>
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>If what follows is a binary operator (e.g. +, -, etc) then this is an
	 * bracketed expression, not a cast.</li>
	 * <li>If what follows is a right-brace then this is a bracketed expression,
	 * not a cast.</li>
	 * <li>Otherwise, this is a cast.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * <p>
	 * Unfortunately, there are two problematic casts: '-' and '('. In Java, the
	 * problem of '-' is resolved carefully as follows:
	 * </p>
	 *
	 * <pre>
	 * CastExpr::= ( PrimitiveType Dimsopt ) UnaryExpression
	 *                 | ( ReferenceType ) UnaryExpressionNotPlusMinus
	 * </pre>
	 *
	 * See JLS 15.16 (Cast Expressions). This means that, in cases where we can
	 * be certain we have a type, then a general expression may follow;
	 * otherwise, only a restricted expression may follow.
	 *
	 * @param wf
	 *            The enclosing WyalFile being constructed. This is necessary to
	 *            construct some nested declarations (e.g. parameters for
	 *            lambdas)
	 * @param generics
	 *            Constraints the set of generic type variables declared in the
	 *            enclosing scope.

	 *            This is necessary to identify local variables within this
	 *            expression.
	 * @param terminated
	 *            This indicates that the expression is known to be terminated
	 *            (or not). An expression that's known to be terminated is one
	 *            which is guaranteed to be followed by something. This is
